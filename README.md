# Season Renewal Feasibility Analysis

## Overview

This project evaluates whether producing a second season of a television series is a viable decision for stakeholders using data driven analysis. It combines audience sentiment, viewer ratings, and engagement metrics to support renewal decisions.

## Data Sources

* Kaggle television and streaming datasets
* IMDb ratings and reviews
* Social media sentiment data

## Methodology

* Text preprocessing and sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques
* Feature engineering combining sentiment scores, ratings, and engagement indicators
* K means clustering to segment shows based on audience response patterns
* Decision tree classification to assess renewal likelihood and identify key influencing factors

## Key Insights

* Identifies audience segments with high and low renewal potential
* Highlights sentiment and ratings as primary drivers of season renewal decisions
* Provides an interpretable framework for stakeholder level decision making

## Technologies Used

* Python
* pandas and NumPy
* scikit learn
* Natural Language Processing
* K means clustering
* Decision Tree classification
